# Open Courts (Otvorené Súdy in Slovak)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/otvorenesudy/otvorenesudy.svg?branch=beta)](https://travis-ci.org/otvorenesudy/otvorenesudy)

Public data project aimed at creating much more user friendly interface to interesting public data provided by [Departement of Justice](http://www.justice.gov.sk) and [The Judical Council](http://www.sudnarada.sk) of Slovak Republic.

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.1
* Rails 3.2
* PostgreSQL 9.1 with trigram extension
* Redis & Resque
* Elasticsearch 0.9

### PostgreSQL Trigram Extension

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql-contrib -y
sudo service postgresql restart
cd /usr/share/postgresql/9.1/extension/
RAILS_ENV=development
psql -U postgres -d opencourts_$RAILS_ENV -f pg_trgm--1.0.sql
```

Note that you need to set up the Trigram extension for all Rails environments you plan to use separately.

### Elasticsearch

Follow the [offical installation guide](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch).

### PDF Processing

```
sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

## Installation

Clone and install.

```
git clone git://github.com/otvorenesudy/otvorenesudy.git
cd otvorenesudy
git submodule init   # initialize submodule, e.g. otvorenesudy-data
git submodule update # or git submodule foreach git pull origin master
bundle install
```

Copy and edit configuration files.

```
cp config/configuration.{yml.example,yml}
cp config/database.{yml.example,yml}
cp config/newrelic.{yml.example,yml}
```

Create database.

```
RAILS_ENV=development rake db:create
```

## Testing

Run specs with `bundle exec rspec`.

Setup small database with real production data for development purposes with `rake fixtures:db:setup`.

## Data

Setup database:

```
rake db:create
rake db:seed
```

Note that the seed data are essential for the next steps.

### Courts and judges from justice.gov.sk

Crawl the necessary data, courts and judges from justice.gov.sk:

```
rake crawl:courts
rake crawl:judges
```

Add court acronyms:

```
rake process:court_acronyms
```

Process known paragraph descriptions:

```
rake process:paragraphs
```

### Hearings and decrees from justice.gov.sk

Start Resque workers:

```
rake resque:workers QUEUE=* COUNT=4
```

Crawl and process hearings and decrees using Resque workers in any order:

```
rake work:hearings:civil
rake work:hearings:criminal
rake work:hearings:special
rake work:decrees
```

### Judge selection procedures from justice.gov.sk

Crawl judge selection procedures:

```
rake crawl:selection_procedures
```

### Judge property declarations from sudnarada.gov.sk

*Warning! Judge property declarations processing currently fails as sudnarada.gov.sk switched from semi-structured (HTML tables) to unstructured (PDF document) publishing for years 2011, 2012 and 2013.* 

Crawl judge property declarations:

```
rake crawl:judge_property_declarations
```

Note that current support is only for property declarations of 2011 and 2012.

Court statistical summaries:

```
rake process:court_statistical_summaries:2011

```
rake process:court_expenses:2010
rake process:court_expenses:2011
rake process:court_expenses:2012
rake process:court_expenses:2013
